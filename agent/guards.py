"""Write guard (T2.2). Every write the agent makes goes through here; the one exception is
restore (agent/snapshot.py), which puts snapshot values back through the admin client.

- Plan-only is the default: nothing is written unless mode == "apply".
- On the live platform, nothing is written until a write journal is attached.
- File writes only to allow-listed row ids, and only the fields in UPDATE_FIELDS.
- Escalations only about allow-listed files (the subject names the file).
- Pre-read: the row must still look the way the plan expected (else StaleRow).
  Callers pass `updated_at` too, so any change by anyone since the plan skips the row.
- Permission check: `_permissions.write` and `_readonly_fields` from the row itself.
- Post-read: confirm the change landed; a mismatch means someone overwrote us. A field we did NOT
  send that differs between the pre-read and the post-read was changed by someone else inside our
  write window: it is traced and returned as `concurrent_change` (the platform has no compare-and-set).
- Every write is recorded once its call returns or fails in any way (Ctrl-C included), before
  the confirming read, so neither a failed call nor a failed confirm can hide a write that happened.
  A file write also records the values it replaced, so restore can put back exactly those.
