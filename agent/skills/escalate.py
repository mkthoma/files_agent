"""A9: routed, de-duplicated escalations.

An escalation needs an AgentSession, so one is created per run (apply mode only).
Escalations can't point at a file, so the subject carries the file id and is
also the de-duplication key. Only this seat's own escalations count for it.
Keystone has no assignable people, so escalations are unassigned; the person
to ask is named in the reason.
