"""Pre-flight (T4.9): refuse a live write run if the platform drifted from the fixture.

On Keystone the write allow-list is pinned to the 9 original Incoming files. Those 9
must be in Incoming, unchanged since the fixture and still tagged 'untriaged'.
Any other row in Incoming can never be written (the guard refuses it and triage
leaves it for a person), so it is a WARNING, not a reason to refuse, provided the
fixture already knew it and it has not changed since. An unknown or changed extra
stays a PROBLEM: duplicate grouping reads every file, so a new row could change how
the 9 are judged and the live expectations would no longer hold. For the same reason,
a row ANYWHERE that is new, changed or gone since the fixture is a PROBLEM if it is
related to one of the 9: it shares a name (duplicate grouping compares names) or a
recorded hash, or it is the same kind of document (the similar-file signal counts
every file of that doc type, or every drawing with that code prefix). A fixture row
that has left Incoming is a PROBLEM. Triage files by folder NAME, and folder names feed
the description and default-folder signals, so any folder added, removed, renamed,
moved or archived since the fixture (or two live folders with the same name) is a
PROBLEM too, and on the live platform the fixture itself must be a fresh capture.

Every name in a message is printable text on one line, and rows of apps this seat
can't open are named by their placeholder. Where the platform says who made a change,
the message says so, so the team knows whom to ask.
