"""Runner (T1.8 / T4.2). Every run is written to disk before anything is scored.

One run = one repeat of one task, in a fresh environment (a fresh fake server,
or the live platform). A task with passes=2 asks its question twice in the same
environment (idempotency). The run file holds: the manifest (first line), every
event, and a final `result` event with the scoped database state before and after.

Guarantees:
- A run whose set-up fails still gets a run file (stub manifest + failed result).
- Live write runs are wrapped in pre-flight, snapshot, a write journal and a restore
  that runs even if collecting the after-state fails.
- A live write task runs once: a second run is refused before it logs in, so it can
  never overwrite the first run's evidence, snapshot or journal. An earlier attempt that
  provably sent nothing (set-up or pre-flight failed, or it stopped before its first write)
  does not count: its files are moved to an attempt-<time>/ folder and the run goes ahead.
- A pass that fails part-way still leaves its decision records and writes in the run file.
- Tasks that depend on the fake server (faults, extra files) never run live.
